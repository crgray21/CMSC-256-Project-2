# CMSC-256-Project-2
This project's requirements were to implement an interface's methods in the way described. 
One method returns all the even characters of the String object, while another method returns
all the odd characters of the string object. RamifyString() requires the method to changes instances 
of "0" or "00" to "VCU" and "Rams" accordingly, but "000" and/or "000 + n " (n = 0) must not be
changed at all, which I wasn't able to come up with a good solution for. The counter I made was 
designed to help with this, but I ran into numerous pitfalls. Another method converted digits in 
the String to roman numerals. Finally, another method counted the amount of non-digits in a string.
